Exercises
The goal of the lab is to put in a rep doing 
everything that you did during the Express - Routers & Controllers lesson:

Be sure to create an array of “fake” data representing some of your awesome
developer skills. The specific properties describing a skill object is up to you!

Implement index functionality for the skills resource

Implement show functionality for the skills resource

Hints
Keep the data resource name short and simple - something like skills.

Following best-practice routing and MVC will result in the following modules for the skills resource:
routes/skills.js
models/skill.js
views/skills
controllers/skills.js
Use RESTful routes
